# React/Redux App

Follow the steps to run the App:

```bash
> npm i
```

Created fake REST API using json-server : https://github.com/typicode/json-server
```bash
> npm i -g json-server
```

Run a server using following command on the port 3030
```bash
> json-server --watch db.json --port 3030
```

Run React and Redux App on the port 3000
```bash
> npm start
```

Above 2 Apps should be running to see the output.
Also I've used Google Map APIs, so the quota might exceed the daily limit as I'm using APIs as a Development Purpose!
